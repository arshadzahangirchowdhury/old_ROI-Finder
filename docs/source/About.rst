The regions of interest (ROI) finder tool groups bacterial cells into two classes corresponding to their live and dead state.

ROI-Finder uses X-ray Fluoroscence Microscopy images and recommends scan locations for cells similar to a cell selected by the user. It also recommends scan locations of live and dead cells.
